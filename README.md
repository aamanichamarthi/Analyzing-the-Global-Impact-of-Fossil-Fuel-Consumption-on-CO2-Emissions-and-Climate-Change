# Analyzing-the-Global-Impact-of-Fossil-Fuel-Consumption-on-CO2-Emissions-and-Climate-Change

This project explores the relationship between
fossil fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, and climate change
through the lens of data visualization. Subsequently, from
using Tableau, a set of dynamic dashboards were created
for energy trends of the world, the move towards the
use of renewable energy, and focusing on the urgency
of decarbonization. According to the principles of the
Utilitarian ethical theory, the analysis promotes the development of renewable energy sources for the benefit of the
general population and reduction of the negative impact of
climate change. It also discredits typical arguments contrary to
renewables, like the expensive nature of renewable energy
and their innate variability, with examples of renewable
technological progress and potential business possibilities
in clean energy industries. In conclusion, the evidence
supports the imperative of moving to a sustainable energy
future and demonstrates the importance of data studies
in combination with accurate envisioning to make global
changes
